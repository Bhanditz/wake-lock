        This document specifies a JavaScript Web API for informing a browser that the user is interacting with the Web page beyond what the browser normally detects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This document has no official standing; it captures one of the proposals discussed to <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/t/allow-developers-to-control-wake-lock-aka-disable-auto-dimming/72">keep browsers from dimming or locking a screen</a>.</p>
      </p>

<section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/webappapis.html#navigator">
        Navigator</a></code> interface this specification extends is defined
        in [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="navigator.poke">
      <h2><code>navigator.poke</code></h2>
      <dl class="idl" title="partial interface Navigator">
        <dt>void poke()</dt>
        <dd>Calling this method informs the browser that the user is still interacting with the page, even though the browser may not have detected it using its usual mechanisms (e.g. pointer or keyboard interaction).</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security considerations</h2>
      <p>The primary use case for this API is to prevent a device from dimming or locking the device screen, as often happens when a device is left without user interactions.</p>
      <p>Keeping the screen from dimming or locking can drain the underlying device power reserve. Preventing it from locking may expose the device and its content to unwanted parties if the user expected it to lock automatically.</p>
      <p>In general, user agents are not expected to request their users permission when this API is used; to mitigate the risks mentioned above, user agents may want to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>only react to <code>navigator.poke</code> on visible browsing contexts;</li>
        <li>ignore the effects of  <code>navigator.poke</code> when the power reserve reaches low levels;</li>
        <li>alert the user at the time the first effect (e.g. screen dim) of inactivity would have happened, with the option of banning further use of that feature from the given origin.</li>
    </section>
    <section id="examples">
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <pre class="example highlight">
// keep the screen from dimming while the video plays
document.querySelector("video").ontimeupdate = navigator.poke;

// in a game using the device orientation as the controler
window.addEventListener("deviceorientation", function (e) {
  navigator.poke();
  // refresh game
});

// in an animation that we're building "manually"
var animate = function () {
  navigator.poke();
  // stuff
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}</pre>

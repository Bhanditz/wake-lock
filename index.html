        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request
        a wake lock. A wake lock prevents some aspect of the device from
        entering a power-saving state (e.g., preventing the system from turning
        off the screen).

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href=

        on GitHub</a> and take part in the discussions.

        Wake Locks
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>wake lock</dfn> prevents some aspect of the device or operating
        system from entering a power-saving state.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification deals specifically with the screen wake lock which
        prevents the screen(s) of the device from entering a power-saving state.

      <h2>Requesting Wake Locks</h2>
      <p>
        Each <a><code>Document</code></a> has a <dfn>request flag</dfn> for the
        <a>wake lock</a>. The request flag is unset when the
        <a><code>Document</code></a> is created. Request flags are used by
        <a>user agent</a> to track if a particular <a><code>Document</code></a>
        is requesting the lock (for the purpose of
        <a title="acquire">acquiring</a> or <a title="release">releasing</a> the
        corresponding operating system lock).
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a><code>Document</code></a> <dfn title="rq-lock">requests wake lock
        </dfn> by setting its lock <a>request flag</a>. This means that the
        <a><code>Document</code></a> indicates to the <a>user agent</a> a
        preference that the underlying operating system apply wake lock, i.e.
        keep the screen on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a><code>Document</code></a> can successfully request wake lock
        regardless of whether the actual lock can be applied by the <a>user
        agent</a> and/or the underlying operating system at the time when the
        request is made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, a <a><code>Document</code></a> <dfn title="cn-rq-lock">
        cancels wake lock request</dfn> by resetting its lock <a>request flag
        </a>. This means that the <a><code>Document</code></a> indicates to the
        <a>user agent</a> that it no longer prefers that the underlying system
        apply the wake lock.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Lock <a>request flag</a> merely indicates a preference of the <a>
          <code>Document</code></a> to have the wake lock applied. Requesting
          the lock or cancelling wake lock request does not entail synchronous
          acquisition or release of the corresponding operating system lock, and
          can only result in an error when the document is explicitly prohibited
          form executing those operations by some security mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          No <a><code>Document</code></a> "owns" the operating system lock and
          the state of operating system lock does not affect the state of the
          lock request flag for any <a><code>Document</code></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, user agent is responsible for mapping the state of request
          flags for all <a><code>Document</code></a>s to the state the operating
          system lock.

      <h2>Managing Wake Locks</h2>
      <p>
        <a>User agent</a> <dfn title="acquire">acquires</dfn> the wake lock by
        requesting the undrelying operating system to apply the lock. The lock
        is considered acquired only when the request to the operating system
        succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, <a>user agent</a> <dfn title="release">releases</dfn> wake
        lock by requesting the underlying operating system to no longer apply
        the wake lock. The lock is considered released only when the request to
        the operating system succeeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a><code>Document</code></a> is <dfn>relevant</dfn> to the wake lock
        if:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The <a><code>Document</code></a> is <a>fully active</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a><code>Document</code></a>'s <a>browsing context</a> is in
          position to interact with the user, i.e. it is in an active tab
          and the browser window is focused.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <a><code>Document</code></a>'s wake lock <a>request flag</a> is
          set.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="note">
        If a <a><code>Document</code></a> does not have a
        <a>browsing context</a>, it is not relevant to the wake lock.
      </div>
      <p>
        The <a>wake lock</a> is <dfn>applicable</dfn> if the state of the
        operating system permits application of the lock (e.g. there is
        sufficient battery charge and wake locking is not disabled by a
        user setting).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>User agent</a> MUST <a>acquire</a> the wake lock when
        all of the following conditions become true:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The wake lock is <a>applicable</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is at least one <a><code>Document</code></a> that is
          <a>relevant</a> to the wake lock.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <a>User agent</a> MUST <a>release</a> the wake lock when any of the
        conditions above become false.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          From the user's perspective, a <a><code>Document</code></a> which has
          requested the wake lock will no longer cause the lock to be applied if
          one of the following happens:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Browser tab or window is closed.
          </li>
          <li>Switching from one tab to another.
          </li>
          <li>Browser is minimized.
          </li>
          <li>Switching from one browser window to another.
          </li>
          <li>Switching from a web browser to another (non-browser)
          application.
          </li>
          <li>Navigating to a different page or reloading a page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Should the tab and/or browser window once again become focused,
          the lock will be applied again if it is still requested and
          the state of operating system permits its application.

      <h2>Additional lock types</h2>
      <p>
        The lock request and management mechanism presented in this document can
        be extended to support additional types of locks by adding new lock
        request flags to <a><code>Document</code></a> interface. E.g. a "system"
        wake lock could be introduced which would prevent the device's cpu,
        radio(s), and other system services from entering a power-saving state
        while allowing the screen to switch off.
